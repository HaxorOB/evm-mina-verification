\chapter{Introduction}

This document is a technical reference to the in-EVM Mina state verification project.

\section{Overview}

The project's purpose is to provide Ethereum users with reliable Mina Protocol's state proof.

The project UX consists of several steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Retrieve Mina Protocol's state proof.
    \item Preprocess it by generating an auxiliary proof.
    \item Submit the preprocessed proof to EVM-enabled cluster.
    \item Verify the proof with EVM.
\end{enumerate}

Such a UX defines projects parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mina Protocol's state retriever (O1Labs' or Chainsafe's protocol implementation).
    \item State proof generator.
    \item Ethereum RPC proof submitter.
    \item EVM-based proof verificator.
\end{enumerate}

The overall architecture diagram is as follows:

Each of these parts will be considered independently.
