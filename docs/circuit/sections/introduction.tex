High level description according to RfP\footnote{\url{https://hackmd.io/u_2Ygx8XS5Ss1aObgOFjkA}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Computing several hash values from the data of the proof. 
This involves using the Poseidon hash function with 63 full rounds both over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$ 
with round constants and MDS matrix specified for $\mathbb{F}_p$\footnote{\url{https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/blob/master/oracle/src/pasta/fp.rs}} 
and for $\mathbb{F}_q$\footnote{\url{https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/blob/master/oracle/src/pasta/fq.rs}}.
	\item Checking arithmetic equations.
	\item Performing one multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) of size $2n_2 + 4 + (2 + 25) = 63$,
for which some of the bases are fixed and some are variable.
	\item For each $i \in \{1, 2\}$, performing a multi-scalar multiplication over $\mathbb{G}_i$ of size $2^{n_i}$
with a fixed array of bases, and with scalars that can be very efficiently computed from the proof.
\end{enumerate}

Note that for MSM in Step $4$:
\begin{center}
	$\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{2^{n_k} - 1}s_i \cdot G_i = H$ \\
	$s_i \coloneqq \prod\limits_{\substack{0 \leq j \leq n_k \\  \text{bits}(i)[j] = 1}} \phi(c_j)$,
\end{center}
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\phi\colon \{0, 1\}^{128} \to \mathbb{F}$ is defined as $\texttt{to\_field}$ in the implementation\footnote{

	\item Given an integer $i < 2^{n_k}$, $\text{bits}(i)$ is defined as the little-endian bit array of length $n$ representing the binary expansion of i. 
	\item $G_0, ..., G_{2^{n_k - 1}} \in \mathbb{G}_k$ is a fixed sequence of group elements\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/blob/master/dlog/commitment/src/srs.rs\#L70}}.
	\item $c_0, ..., c_{n_k -1} \in \{0, 1\}^{128}$ is a sequence of challenges. 
\end{itemize}

We use the same 15-wires PLONK circuits that are designed for Mina.\footnote{\url{https://o1-labs.github.io/mina-book/specs/15_wires/15_wires.html}}
